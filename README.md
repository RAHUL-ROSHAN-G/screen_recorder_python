# screen_recorder_python

Hi I am Rahul Roshan G, find the code for record the screen. Here you can just run the code and after that a python screen is shown for 1 millisecond and minimised down.
After finishing the recording maximise the screen which was recording and just press 'q' on your keyboard. The recording will be saved in the "recordings" folder. 
Please create a folder called "recordings" [please note the spellings] so that all the recordings saved there.  I have used curse, os, cv2, numpy, pyautogui used with python.

Happy coding.
